<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.trench</em> adds an earthwork estimation function to GRASS GIS.
Its purpose is to calculate an estimated value for eartworks volume and
also create map of the results
<p>
For a successful run, the module needs:
<p>
<ul>
<li>a DTM representing the surface
</li>
<li>a vector coverage with one and only one line being the path
</li>
<li>parameters of the trapezoid to be 'excavated'
</li>
<li>starting and ending height of the path (bottom point height
at the middle of the trapezoid
</li>
</ul>
The result will be a set of values in map units like the volume in m<sup>3</sup> and length in meters, for example.
A new dtm is created showing the after-excavation state and another raster
also calculated containing the scale (depth) of excavation at eat points.

<h3>Tips and tricks</h3>
To make processing faster
Setting a higher resolution makes the estimation more exact but also
reults a longer runtime.
